# A-PathFinding-Algorithm-Visualizer
This is my project for the A* pathfinding algorithm visualizer 

This visualizer uses the pygame library for finding shortest path between two points on a grid.

A* algorithm:
A* algorithm is a informed search pathfinding algorithm which uses a hueristic or estimate distance from every node to the end node also along with the shortest distance to minimise the overall number of neighbors traversed for finding the shortest distance.
